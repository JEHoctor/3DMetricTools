#3DMeshMetric

##What is it?

3DMeshMetric is a visualization tool based on the VTK library.

Its main feature is to compute and display surface-to-surface distance between two triangle meshes using user-specified uniform sampling (based on the source code of MeshValmet: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/meshvalmet).

3DMeshMetric also offers all the basic tools to visualize meshes such as color, opacity, smoothing, down sampling or type of representation.

3DMeshMetric also contains an additional tool called ModelToModelDistance that computes distances between two triangle meshes (using the VTK library). This tool can be used either as a command line tool or integrated in 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org) as a CLI module. It is available in 3D Slicer as an extension to facilitate the download and installation process.
